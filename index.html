									<h2><span class="pinkhighlight">Abhayraj</span> who?</h2><hr>
									<p></p>
									<p>I was sorely tempted to ask a friend to describe me, to save myself from introspecting while writing the code for this website. I thought about asking people from my different friend groups - which led me to an important realization. By nature, I'm a multi-faceted person. I have widely varying interests with one focal point - a passion for creation. I enjoy creating things more than anything else. Be it building a pointlessly convoluted electrical project, penning a poem furiously at 3 in the morning, or cooking a great-tasting dish with the sparse contents of my refrigerator, I'm addicted to the euphoria of accomplishment.</p>
									<p>At my request, a relative came up with a catchy description for my résumé: <i>Engineering student with a flair for digital art and a passion for literature.</i> I thank him for his efforts. As accurate as it is, I feel that taglines such as this don't always convey the substance behind the words. Instead, to answer the question above, I rely on the wisdom of Mahatma Gandhi - </p>
									<ul>
									<i>"A man is the sum of his actions, of what he has done, of what he can do, Nothing else."</i>
									</ul>
									This website is my effort to show you what I have done, and I will leave it up to you to decide what I can do.<br><br><br>

									<p>Not everyone would classify graphic design as art, but to me, design is an opportunity to express my creative side. My attempts at portraying moods in items as mundane as posters, magazines, and other forms are catalogued here.<br><br><i>(It helps that the word 'art' is more striking than 'graphic design' when superimposed on a photograph.)</i><br><br></p>

									<p>Some projects were pursued by me at a competition, as part of a course at university, or were otherwise formally documented. A number of these received various accolades or prizes that have been listed.<br><br>Other projects were small and large projects that I have pursued as part of my interest in how things work. These haven't received formal recognition, but are definitely worth looking at!</p>

									<p>There are few things as powerful as the written word. Books have the power to transform worlds; poems can change futures; a solitary sentence can force your world to a standstill as you contemplate its ramifications.<br><br>I have, on some occasions, attempted to harness the power of words to make sense of my wandering, hazy thoughts.<br><br>Be it poetry or prose, I have found the act of writing to be extremely cathartic. At times, I have also attempted to pen my take on or reaction to media such as books, movies, or TV shows.</p>
